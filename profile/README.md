This organization collects all Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) software, repositories, documentation and resources. It is maintained by the EIC Software Group and the EPIC Collaboration Working Groups.

## How to join?

All EIC users may request to become part of this organization. Simply email the [EIC User Group Software Working Group conveners](mailto:eicug-software-conveners@eicug.org) from your institutional email address with your GitHub account and whether you or your sponsor/advisor is a member of the EIC User Group listed on the [Phone Book](https://phonebook.sdcc.bnl.gov/eic/client/). This will give you read access to all public repositories.

You may also wish to join teams such as [EPIC devs](https://github.com/orgs/eic/teams/epic-devs) to gain write access to select repositories.
