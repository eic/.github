## How to join?

Please contact [eicug-software-conveners@eicug.org](mailto:eicug-software-conveners@eicug.org) from your *institutional* email address to demonstrate affiliation. In your email, please state your GitHub username and whether you or your sponsor/advisor is a member of the EICUG. Either you or your sponsor/advisor needs to be listed in the [EIC User Group Phone Book](https://phonebook.sdcc.bnl.gov/eic/client/). If your GitHub username is not easily related to your name, your GitHub profile must list at least your first name.

This will give you read access to all public repositories.
